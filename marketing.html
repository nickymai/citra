								<h3>Context of campaign and promotional activities</h3>
	<h4>Communication message</h4>
								<p>Let us challenge societal conventions – make #stayingsober great again.
Our product is outstanding through its bold message and design – who says you need alcoholic beverages to be the coolest at the party? We question and challenge socially entrenched principles while embracing individuality and redefining the meaning of coolness. The message is in it: don't let society tell you what to do, be yourself and do your own thing - you are cool the way you are!
								</p>
<h4>positioning</h4>
					<p>High quality, moderate cost.
We don't believe in being average - neither in terms of your personality nor in terms of the quality of our products. Therefore, our products are of superior quality and at the same time available at an affordable price for everyone. There are quite a few non-alcoholic beers on the market, but what makes them so special? right, nothing! citra stands out in the boring market of non-alcoholic beers through explosive boldness and bravery of the message within. 
</p>			
	<h4>Communication Goal</h4>
	<p>The overall goal of all communication measures is to raise brand awareness for the new brand citra. As we are fully new to the beverage market and need to stand out between some existing and known brands, it is necessary to differentiate our brand from the competition and build a long-lasting brand image. We aim to become a known and memorable brand in the market while taking a confident position on the social pressure of drinking alcohol in public.</p>
	<h4>Communication Objectives</h4>
	<p>With the brand communication measures, we want to increase brand reach to 5000 people by April 14th, 2022. This means that a sum of 5000 people should get in contact with citra via all social media activities.</p>
	<h4>Reach Objectives</h4>
	<p>Instagram: We strive to gain 500 organic Instagram followers until April 14th, 2022 and reach 2000 people at least once with our posts. This should be reached via sharing content through the accounts of the citra founders, using appropriate and well researched hashtags and spreading it in several student groups as they can be seen as the main target group. The goal might appear quite low – we decided not to put any money in the advertisement tools of the app at the beginning. When we get the first feedback for our content, we can draw conclusions of what performs best and put money into further advertising then.<br> TikTok: For brand consistency, we decided to start our TikTok account with the same contents as the Instagram account. Later, more TikTok-related trend videos are planned. The goal for TikTok is to reach 100 people at first, as the algorithm appears to be a bit tricky and hard to crack. By consistently posting content and building a base followership, the goals will be adjusted after 1 month.
</p>
	<h4>Affect Objectives</h4>
	<p>We want the users and everyone that gets in contact with our brand to become aware of a) the existence of the new brand and b) the expressive message behind it. Seeing and drinking citra should feel intense while embracing self-confidence: You always felt like an outsider while rejecting alcohol at a party? No need to worry, citra will make you stand out, take a clear position and be the best version of yourself. The first contact with the brand makes you wake up, pay attention to the the criticism of society with a wink of the eye and whet your appetite for more. Any individual drinking citra beer feels truly happy, committed and as a part of a new, bold community.</p>
	<h4>Response Objectives</h4>
	<p>In order to increase the general reach, we want the audience to engage in our social media activities by liking, commenting, tagging others and sharing. The activation should be performed via calls for user generated content, raffles to win the actual product and the integration of an influencer who is promoting the product with an influencer discount code. This goes for Instagram as well as for TikTok: Making the users interact with our contents will intensify the relationship to the audience and build & broaden a community.</p>
